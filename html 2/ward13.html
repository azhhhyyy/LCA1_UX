<p style="text-align: justify; padding-right: 2%">The idea for 'Ward 13' was to create a horror puzzle solving game, inspired by the
    recent trend of analog horror, which plays with the idea of retro found footage style
    horror, and mix it with liminal horror of the same era, which leaves the
    player/character in hauntingly nostalgic, but eerie environments with seemingly no
    exit. The inspiration for using an 8-bit pixellated artstyle came from games that existed
    around the time that analog and liminal horror is based on, the late 1900s. (old
    nintendo game, eg: pokemon). I believe that an 8bit game with a horror story,
    along with eerie 8-bit music could create an uncomfortable and unsettling but
    unique horror experience for the player.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; padding-right: 2%">Ward 13' follows "Michael", a resident patient of Rolling Hills Mental Asylum, on his downwards spiral through his schizophrenia and paranoia, after he overhears
his doctor "Dr. Shipman" talking about using Michael as a test subject for
experimental medicine, and to explore the limits of the human mind under torture
We see a deranged Michael find clues that help him solve puzzles and make his
way through the facility, avoiding hospital staff, encountering looping corridors and
confusing puzzles, to uncover more about the terrifying history of Rolling Hills, and
the plans of the psychotic Dr Shipman.
Michael must find his way out of the hospital, in order to live,</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; padding-right: 2%">The idea behind the character was to try and reflect unstable emotions and
    insanity on his face; hence the references were actual patients from criminal
    instituitions that we're diagnosed with psychosis and schizophrenia.
